umt-server1 is a web server written in Golang that handles the Ultimate Music Toy (UMT) web app. The composition engine in JavaScript is incorporated (as of 2016-03-27) from the umt repository where it was originally developed as a standalone web page into umt.go here. The file ws.go in the main directory is a web server that simply picks up the web requests and hands them off to the relevant app; each app has its own package in Go. Web requests for UMT are simply handed off to umt.go, and everything else is handled from there. The only other package needed is the login package which identifies who logged in and assigns everyone user IDs.

This is called server1 because the plan is to have 2 servers: one that runs on the internet that handles saving and loading of tunes (or more precisely, of parameter sets), and basic administrative chores like that. It will create MIDI files and maybe someday handle things like creation of sheet music. The other server, server2, will run on the same machine as the web interface, and will handle real-time instrument playback over non-WebAudio API systems, such as MIDI and OSC. As of right now, server2 hasn't been started yet, so only server1 exists.
